## Library Management System Project Description

 Introduction:
The provided C++ code implements a simple Library Management System. This system allows users to manage a collection of books and users within a library. The key functionalities include adding books, displaying the list of books, adding users, and displaying the list of users. The system is menu-driven, where users can interact with the program by choosing options from the menu.

 Description:
# Structures:
- Book Structure:
  - `int bookId`: Unique identifier for each book.
  - `string title`: Title of the book.
  - `string author`: Author of the book.
  - `bool isAvailable`: Indicates whether the book is available or not.

- User Structure:
  - `int userId`: Unique identifier for each user.
  - `string username`: Username of the user.
  - `string password`: Password of the user.

# Functions:
1. displayMenu():
   - Displays the menu options for the Library Management System.

2. addBook(Book books[], int &bookCount):
   - Adds a new book to the system with user input for book details.
   - Checks for the maximum limit of books.

3. displayBooks(const Book books[], int bookCount):
   - Displays the list of books with their details (ID, Title, Author, Availability).

4. addUser(User users[], int &userCount):
   - Adds a new user to the system with user input for user details.
   - Checks for the maximum limit of users.

5. displayUsers(const User users[], int userCount):
   - Displays the list of users with their details (ID, Username, Password).

# Main Function:
- Initializes arrays for books and users with maximum limits.
- Uses a do-while loop to repeatedly display the menu and execute user choices until the user chooses to exit.

 Process:
1. The program starts by displaying the menu.
2. Users choose from the menu options (Add Book, Display Books, Add User, Display Users, Exit).
3. Based on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called to perform the desired operation.
4. The process continues until the user chooses to exit.

 Advantages:
- Simple and user-friendly interface.
- Allows easy management of books and users in a library setting.
- Menu-driven system simplifies user interactions.

 Benefits:
- Efficiently organizes information about books and users.
- Provides a clear overview of the library's resources.

 Conclusion:
The Library Management System is a basic yet effective program for managing a library's book and user information. While it lacks advanced features, it serves as a foundation that can be expanded upon for more complex library management systems. The system's simplicity makes it suitable for small-scale libraries or educational purposes.

Note: Additional features such as book checkout, return, and user authentication could be implemented to enhance the system's functionality.*
